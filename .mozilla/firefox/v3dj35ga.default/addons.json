Help bring vimperator into the age of e10s and WebExtensions!\n\nVimperator is a free browser add-on for Firefox, which makes it look and behave like the Vim text editor. It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\nIf there are any issues, please check out our issue tracker https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues and add the issue if it isn't already recorded.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/582324/vimperator-3.16.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":465385,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":233,"totalDownloads":890590,"weeklyDownloads":2235,"dailyUsers":15564,"updateDate":1487370928000,"supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org"},{"id":"tabgroups@quicksaver","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/671/671381-32.png?modified=1485557628","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/671/671381-64.png?modified=1485557628"},"name":"Tab Groups","type":"extension","version":"2.1.4","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Quicksaver","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/quicksaver/?src=api"},"description":"Tab Groups are an easy way to organize a lot of tabs. You can visually group related tabs, switch between groups, and quickly search through all of your tabs to switch to a specific one.","fullDescription":"IMPORTANT: The add-on will not receive any more updates and will stop working by next November with Firefox 57! Click here for more info.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContact Info: For reporting problems and bugs, or if you have comments or suggestions, please either send me an email (quicksaver@gmail.com) or go to https://github.com/Quicksaver/Tab-Groups/issues and create an issue, this is so I have a way to communicate with you if I need to.\n\nTab Groups, formerly known as Panorama or TabView, allows you to manage and organize a large number of open tabs.\n\nGroups are incredibly easy to use! When you first install the add-on, the Tab Groups button will appear next to your tabs, but you can move it anywhere you want in the window. Use it to open a quick access panel to quickly switch between your groups or even to switch to a specific tab.\n\nEnter groups management view through that panel and drag tabs across groups or out of their current group to create a new one. When you're done, just click on a tab to leave groups view and go to the chosen tab; only the tabs in the chosen group will be visible. It's that simple.\n\nYou can name groups, resize them and rearrange them visually however you like. Create groups for research, movies, work, fun and all the other various tasks you perform on your browser. You'll organize all those dozens of tabs you have open in no time!\n\nOr even keep all your tabs in a single group, and use the add-on to swiftly find and switch to any tab you want, without having to lose time looking for it in the middle of all your other tabs at the top.\n\nYou can also customize a series of keyboard shortcuts in the add-on's preferences, to quickly enter and leave groups view, open the quick access panel, or switch to other groups using just your keyboard.\n\nBackup and Restore your tabs and groups any time you want! Everything crashes once in a while, but now you can be sure you never lose your tabs again when that happens.\n- Manually backup your groups information at any time to a file anywhere on your disk for safe-keeping. Later, you can restore whole groups from there, or even just a single tab if that's all you want.\n- You can also restore groups and tabs from several automated backups created by Firefox and Tab Groups:\n-- Current Session Recovery: Firefox keeps your current session's information here, to be used in case of crashes. You probably won't be using it much, since whatever groups and tabs you close will be removed from this file as well.\n-- Session Recovery Backup: holds much of the same information as the file above, also used for crash-protection. But it's usually saved with a little delay, so it could be useful in a few cases.\n-- Previous Session: ever restart Firefox to see only your homepage, and all your other tabs gone? Or maybe just forgot to bookmark an important tab from yesterday? More often than not, you can get it all back here.\n-- Firefox Upgrade Backup: every time Firefox upgrades, it holds onto a backup of your session at that point for a while, just in case the upgrade fails and corrupts the session. These should help if all you need is to get your tabs back from before the upgrade.\n-- Tab Groups Update Backup: similar to the above, but for backups created when this add-on updates instead.\n-- Groups Migration Backup: this is a backup of your session made when Firefox first updated to 45. If you've installed Firefox only after, or if you installed this add-on before that happened, then you likely will never see (or need) this.\n-- Groups Manual Backup: if you keep the default file name and save location when backing up your groups, you can also access them from the quick access menu when restoring.\n-- Session Manager Backup: these are session files kept by Session Manager, which is fully compatible with Tab Groups.\n-- Tab Mix Plus Backup: similar to the above, these are session files kept by Tab Mix Plus, which is also fully compatible with Tab Groups.\n\nOther features:\n- There are several different layouts available, as well as many display options; set them to your taste so that your groups always work to your advantage.\n- Start typing anywhere in groups view to search for a specific tab.\n- Use catch rules to automatically move tabs to specific groups by means of regular expressions.\n- Integrates with Tab Mix Plus's options to style unloaded and unread tabs.\n\nNotice: this add-on is based on the Firefox feature of the same name that was removed in Firefox 45. Initially, it was barely more than a copy of that same code that existed in Firefox itself. Since then, almost all of it has been rewritten, not only to improve performance and stability, but also to implement several new features. Despite this, the concept of groups at the core of the add-on remains the same, but hopefully even more awesome than ever.\n\nHidden preferences: I suggest you don't change either of these, so that the add-on adjusts automatically to your environment.\nextensions.tabgroups.forceBrightText - Define which theme to load in groups view. \"0\" is the default value, the add-on will choose based on your current Firefox and system themes; \"1\" will always load the light theme, and \"2\" will always load the dark theme.\nextensions.tabgroups.overrideViewportRatio - Set the aspect ratio for the tab thumbnails. Keep empty to let the add-on adapt to your screen size; any integer or fraction in the form \"width/height\" will be used as a constant aspect ratio for tab thumbnails.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174740.png?src=api&modified=1485523407","width":"646","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174740.png?src=api&modified=1485523407","thumbnailWidth":"185","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"When first installed, the toolbar button is placed next to the tabs.

To use: Right click in a real HTML table for the \"tabletools2\" option.","fullDescription":"Note everyone! This addon is NOT e10s compatible as it uses XUL (which is not e10s compatible). Most non-e10s compatible addons will slow down FF a lot if you enable multi-process in options. So you have to either disable the option or the addon.\n\nWhether you're a sports fan checking out stats of your favorite quarterbacks, a music fan viewing a listing of top selling albums, a gamer searching for top games, a shopper comparison shopping, a scientist analyzing data tables ..., you'll find TableTools2 tremendously helpful. Simply take a look at the demo videos for TableTools2 at http://youtube.com/user/tabletools2 for demos where TT2 was used to help all the above situations and more!\n\nNote: TableTools2 supersedes TableTools (T2F3) and TableSort.\n\nHere's a long list of what TableTools2 could do for a plain old HTML table:\n\n    Sorting:\n        Auto-detects and sorts multiple data types (number, currency, IP address, date/time, string, alphanumeric. Even sorts images' alternative text, text inside textbox, textarea, dropdown menu ...). User can designate data types easily with context menu options.\n        Supports multiple-column sort, the most requested advanced sorting feature. Icons tells you the sorting order and direction of the columns.\n    Filtering:\n        Drop-down list filtering - It's like Excel's \"Auto-Filter\" feature, except that it's better as TableTools2 supports more data types.\n    Searching:\n        It's a combination of Excel's \"Find\" + \"Custom-Filter\" feature and definitely more!\n        For \"Find\", it allows finding the matching values in the current column or in all columns, or the non-matching values in current column or all columns; it allows regular expressions too for advanced searching.\n        For \"Custom-Filter\", range operations are supported \">5 | <3\" gives you anything bigger than 5 or smaller than 3; \">=3 & <= 5\" gives you numbers between 3 and 5 (including 3 and 5); \">=01/01/1990 & <01/01/2000\" gives you all dates in the 90s decade. All sorting data types are supported for range operations!\n    Copying:\n        Copy the entire table, the selected rows, the selected columns, or the selected cells, to clipboard in any of these formats: HTML, tab-delimited, or a TableTools2-unique \"justified tab-delimited\" format which is good for pasting into both emails and Excel.\n    Charting:\n        In a few clicks, the HTML table data could be transformed into a bubble, scatter, pie, line, histogram or a unique frequency chart which counts frequency of each unique values in the column for you. It's really cool!\n        For this feature to work, I coded an easy-to-use adapter and user interface for Isaac Neuhaus' excellent CanvasXpress package so TableTools2 users don't need to learn any programming or do even copy/pasting. Just a few mouse clicks is all!\n    Rearranging:\n        Press down the 'Ctrl' key while you right-click and drag mouse will allow you to drag and drop columns and rows to rearrange them!\n    Summarizing:\n        With one mouse click, TableTools2 will give you the minimum, maximum, total count and unique value count for every table column. For numeric/currency columns, it'll also give you average, median, standard deviation and sum.\n    Combining:\n        If you see a multi-page or multi-section table and wants to sort the table as one big combined table, it's just a few mouse clicks using TableTools2. And don't forget you can then chart/filter/summarize ... for the big table too.\n    Comparing:\n        If you see several tables of identical format for different products, TableTools2 lets you combine them \"horizontally\" (as versus the \"vertical\" way of the \"Combining\" feature above) such that you could easily do side-by-side comparison of the data in the same table, and more importantly, chart a comparison really easily.\n    Misc. features:\n        Hide/unhide columns.\n        Restrict range of data rows (so non-data rows won't participate in sorting, filtering ...).\n        Context menu allows access to all features.\n        Default keyboard shortcuts provided for all features except sorting as user-designated data types (as there're too many, but sort-as-number does have shortcut as it's used the most). Options menu allows changing or disabling the shortcuts.\n        Context menu has reminder of keyboard shortcuts for the features, and the reminder could be turned off in options.\n        Very fast, works in older FF and FF4.0\n        In most cases, nested tables and tables with colspans work fine. Tables with rowspans do not work well.\n        I put introduction and demo videos on my TableTools2 youtube channel at http://youtube.com/user/tabletools2. Check it out for feature demonstration. Send me request if you need demoing of some TT2 features not demo-ed in there.\n    Last but NOT the least:\n        TableTools2 is of course totally free. However, donation is much appreciated if you like it and have the means. You could also visit the contribution page to see non-donation ways to help out!\n        Making this extension took tremendous amount of time (and surely will kill (most of) future sales of my commercial cross-browser TableTools javascript package). But just like most FF extensions, they weren't made for making money. I really put in the effort for the old TableTools users who've been kind and supportive and even donated to help. The money wasn't much, but the goodwill was huge. So don't just thank me for the extension, thank yourselves, because really, otherwise I would've given up as it's just so hard to squeeze out the time b/w a full-time job and full schedule with kids.\n        That brings up another important point: I've seen cases where some FF users (and maybe more so for Google Chrome users) where there's a false sense of entitlement, as if the authors of free extensions deserved to be put in a verbal and ratings purgatory if they failed to timely push out updates and/or fix bugs. Despite my best effort, there will be bugs and issues with TableTools2 as there are an incredible number of weird HTML tables out there on the web (and user's OS/installed extensions are vastly different too). If you need me to do something to help, derogatory comment or rating threats need not apply. Again, I'm not in it for the ratings or the donations - I squeezed out impossible time out of gratitude (and a bit guilt of the delay) to the good users. I am really busy, but if you're polite and reasonable, I will try my best to help.\n\n\nDon't forget to check out my \"Fastest Search\" extension that saves your time when doing search, select-n-search, copy/paste, open links/save images!","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55379.png?src=api&modified=1301570527","width":"700","height":"496","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55379.png?src=api&modified=1301570527","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"141","caption":"Charting of HTML table by TableTools2 - Pie Chart"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55408.png?src=api&modified=1301570527","width":"700","height":"509","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55408.png?src=api&modified=1301570527","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"Benchmark data (smaller the better) of FF4 vs. Chrome10 etc. in Sunspider on my laptop - Histogram Chart"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55382.png?src=api&modified=1301570527","width":"700","height":"390","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55382.png?src=api&modified=1301570527","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"111","caption":"Copy selected rows as justified tab-delimited format (with copy/paste result inserted in screenshot) using TableTools2"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55384.png?src=api&modified=1301570527","width":"700","height":"127","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55384.png?src=api&modified=1301570527","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"36","caption":"Both search and dropdown filters displayed.

It will work if you don't, but your sync password and encryption keys will be stored unprotected in firefox (unless you also set a master password for firefox... but why would you want to do that).\n\nFeatures:\n* Secure integration with KeePass using the KeePassHttp plugin\n** https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/ download from https://passifox.appspot.com/KeePassHttp.plgx\n* Automated password form fill\n* Supports password form fill exactly the same way as the built-in Firefox login manager\n* New passwords entered into forms will be saved into KeePass automatically\n* Context menu entries for manually selecting username and password fields to fill\n* Notifications are always displayed whenever passwords are retrieved from KeePass, in some instances it is even possible to deny and allow access. (When the host names do not match exactly, user interaction is required to allow access; the decision can be remembered)\n* Open source, and available for inspection at https://github.com/pfn/passifox\n* Also supported on Chrome: use the same KeePass database for Firefox and Google Chrome\n* Supports Firefox Sync-- see https://github.com/pfn/passifox/issues/closed#issue/5\n\nFuture features and enhancements:\n* Automatic password generation and entry creation\n\nRequirements:\n* KeePass 2 -- http://keepass.info version 2.17 or newer\n* KeePassHttp -- https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/ download at https://passifox.appspot.com/KeePassHttp.plgx\n\nDirections:\n1) Install KeePass\n2) Install KeePassHttp by dropping KeePassHttp.plgx into the KeePass Program Files directory\n2a) Log into KeePass\n2b) Verify KeePassHttp has been installed correctly by checking Tools > Plugins\n3) Navigate to any page containing a password\n4) Click the \"Connect\" button that appears in the drop down notification\n5) Switch to the KeePass window and enter a descriptive name for your \"Firefox Browser\" into the dialog that popped up and click save.\n6) Your passwords are now securely retrieved from KeePass and automatically entered into password forms and fields when needed.\n7) Passwords in KeePass should be entered with the \"Title\" containing the domain or host name for the site in question; KeePassHttp does some basic pattern matching, for example \"google.com\" would match http://login.google.com/ if there were such a thing.\nOptional) For extra security, the KeePass association can be protected with a Firefox master password (overkill IMO)\n\nLinux and Mac users:\nIf you are using KeePass with Mono, then you're in luck. I have tested KeePassHttp with Mono 2.6.7 and it appears to work well. I cannot get the plgx file to work on Linux, perhaps you may have more luck, but I can get my dll files to work directly when put into the KeePass directory (possibly the Plugin directory as well, I have not tried). You can get KeePassHttp.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll from https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/tree/master/KeePassHttp\n\nWindows users:\nIf the PLGX file does not work, it is possible to use the DLL files as mentioned above for Linux and Mac users.
